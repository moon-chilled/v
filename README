v is designed to fail at all costs

It is for this reason that its primary implementation is written in c (an
incredibly un-hip, un-sexy language), it is extremely slow (despite the
implementation language), is not permissively licensed, is not documented, and
has an ungooglable name.

v's core editing model is sound, however, which will hopefully result in its
adoption only by academics; having spurned ml, apl, _and_ lisp, industry
deserves no better than it's gotten.
